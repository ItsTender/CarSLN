<h1> About  Me & the Journey </h1>

<a> I Consider myself a Dedicated and Passionate Computer Enjoyer. I always loved Messing around with Computer Parts and Typing Code from a very Young age.
and This App might as well be the Biggest so Far in my Journey of Becoming a Real Computer Engineer! </a>

<a> I began Working on this App as early as the end of September or in other words nearly the Start of 12th Grade, it was Rough at the Beginning but i made it here at last after many challenges and obstacles.......... </a>

<a> This project will not be forgotten even after the end of high school and will be updated constantly, and there are many new features still in mind for future updates! </a>
